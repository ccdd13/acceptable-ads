# Acceptable Ads
I use an ad blocker not because I hate ads, but because it makes the Internet so much more safe and less annoying. Most advertising is horrible and annoying, but there are exceptions.

However, ad blocking lists like EasyList are dedicated to blocking *all* ads. The only maintained "Acceptable Ads" list is by Eyeo, Inc., which basically takes bribes to whitelist ads. I wanted to start an Acceptable Ads list that was of the people, by the people and for the people.

## Whitelisted
### Websites
* DuckDuckGo
* Ecosia
* ReadTheDocs
* Reddit
* JSFiddle
* Quora
* Dribbble
* Gmail
### Networks
* BuySellAds
* Carbon Ads
* Connatix
* Nativo
* Flipp
* TripleLift
* Dunhill Travel Deals
* ShareASale
* Amazon Product Links
* Adzerk

## Criteria
* Ads should be beautiful and not annoying. Ads should blend nicely with the content on the page and not interrupt the user.
* Ads should not use header-to-header bidding or excessive ad-tech. I should not have to whitelist 23 domains just to whitelist one ad.
* Special exceptions can be made in some cases, e.g. in Ecosia, the point of the search engine is ads, and the search engine plants trees by showing ads. Removing ads from Ecosia would defeat the whole purpose of the search engine.

## Installation
I recommend the [uBlock Origin](https://getublockorigin.com) ad blocker. To whitelist acceptable ads in uBlock Origin, go to the "Filter Lists" tab, click "Import" at the bottom of the page, paste the URL below, and click "Save Changes".
